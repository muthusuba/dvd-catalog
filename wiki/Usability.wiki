#Usability tips/improvements

= Usability =

To improve usability, especially when indexing a lot of CDs/DVDs, there are few tips:

1. Enter the details for the first disc to index and click on index.
2. When the indexing is complete the cursor now points to the CD/DVD ID for the user to change the DVD number/name.
3. The user can now change the name/id and press enter to start indexing a new disc.
