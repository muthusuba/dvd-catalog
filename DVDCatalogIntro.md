## DVD Catalog ##
> A CD/DVD Management Software.

# Introduction #

DVD Catalog is a CD/DVD Management Software. You could also call it a Personal CD/DVD Library Software.

I was searching for such a software which was open source - couldn't find anything really useful and _simple_. So, here's the project which has the aim to organize the CDs and DVDs at ones _home_.

I have collections of OSS Softwares downloaded from the Internet. I would then (sometime in the future) want to search for a particular software and a version. This software _hopefully_ will solve my problem.

You could also use this for movies, mp3s, ...

[PS: I ain't limiting its use for home - use it anywhere]

# Current Project Aims #

  * Simple CD/DVD management software with _decent_ UI.
  * Database is (kind-of) _smaller_ in size.
  * Should be able to create multiple databases.
  * Should be able to create multiple tables(in this case CD/DVD Groups).
  * Simple sqlite3 database with:
  * Details like filename, filetype, filepath, filesize, ratings and comments.
  * Auto indexing of directories and sub-directories. i.e. The user selects a directory or drive to scan and index - for creating a database.
  * Personal ratings
  * Entries to a certain extent
  * **Search** for a particular entry - based on filename, filesize, filetype, ...

As an additional _feature_. This project should also help people learning QT :)

# Future Project Aims #
  * Integrating imdb information. Probably, downloaded and displayed as and when the user wants.
  * Cool UI
  * ...

Please add more ideas...
